# CosmosGNU
**A project made for replicating GNU functionality for Cosmos.**
### We are planning to implement following features:
- GNU-like commands and their usage
- Own GCC-like program to compile C code and ability to execute compiled code
- It's own shell (like bash, but not bash)
- Updated DotNetParser (will be added a lot of methods)
- Maybe updated FAT32 driver or added new like EXT4 driver (i... i don't think we can do that)
